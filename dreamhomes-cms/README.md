## 🏗️ Monolithic Deployment (Full App)

The frontend application has been integrated into the Strapi `public` folder. This means you can serve both the API and the Website from the same server.

- **Frontend URL**: `http://localhost:1337/` (or your production URL)
- **Admin Panel**: `http://localhost:1337/admin`

To deploy to production, simply build the project (`npm run build`) and deploy the `dreamhomes-cms` folder to your provider of choice (Heroku, Railway, Strapi Cloud, etc.).
